Process of writing a twitter bot that tweets links to youtube videos.
We're going to do this in roughly 8 steps:
1. ~~Get list of my subscriptions from YouTube.~~
2. ~~Mark channels as music or blog.~~
3. For each channel list of recent videos and store that in a database.
4. Take the last video link and download the video.
5. Clip the video and clip it to 40s.
6. Tweet that video (title, link to Youtube)
7. Save link to tweet, video in database
8. Check every 30 minutes if there's a new video, if yes start from 4.

I'm going to try document this all on [my blog](sidneyochieng.co.ke) so follow along over there.
