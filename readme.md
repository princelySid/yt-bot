Process of writing a twitter bot that tweets links to youtube videos.
We're going to do this in roughly 8 steps:
1. ~~Get list of my subscriptions from YouTube.~~
2. ~~Mark channels as music or blog.~~
3. ~~For each channel list of recent videos and store that in a database.~~
4. Take the last video link and download the video.
5. Clip the video and clip it to 40s.
6. ~~Tweet that video (title, link to Youtube)~~
7. Save link to tweet, video in database
8. Check every 30 minutes if there's a new video, if yes start from 4.

I'm going to try document this all on [my blog](https://sidneyochieng.co.ke/) so follow along over there.

Other todos:
- make it so it doesn't send out shorts
- make it so it can only tweet one link per channel per day
