Sheer, boundless passion for automobiles is what led to the start of Daimlar Motorsports Kenya, which in turn has grown to being a car enthusiast community ‚Äì it's a passion that only true petrol heads can understand"

We aim to decolonise, digitise and safeguard cultural heritage and history and provide a safe space to challenge the stories of today that have been shaped by a distorted view from the past.

The name Hiistoriya has a dual meaning, in classic Swahili it means history, while in contemporary Swahili, ‚Äúhii stori ya‚Äù is slang for ‚Äúthe story of‚Ä¶‚Äù. The platform is a bridge between the past, present and the future. Hiistoriya interlinks our history with our current cultural traditions and practices while weaving a future of greater self-awareness."
