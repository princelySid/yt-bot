Everyday Astronaut,"Rocket science. A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating.

My name’s Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heels in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more... the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. 

But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can. 

Rocket science is awesome, and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be excited.

mau from nowhere,"mau from nowhere blends hip-hop, R&B, and electronic textures into a soulful, genre-bending sound shaped between Nairobi, the UK, and the Netherlands. His music is both urgent and meditative — weaving melodic raps with reflective songwriting — drawing comparisons to Obongjayar, Noname, and Yinka Bernie, with influences spanning Outkast to Bloc Party.

His 2025 collaborative album PRESSURE with producer hihi, featuring COLORS-backed single “Let It Pass,” earned global attention from OkayAfrica, Music Crowns, and Wordplay Magazine. In 2024, his EP SOFT STEPS was praised by CLASH, Atwood, and 1883 for its fearless experimentation.

As a performer, mau has steadily built a reputation for intimate yet powerful live shows, carrying his sonic resonance and authenticity to stages in Nairobi and beyond. Named Apple Music’s Up Next Artist (May 2023) and spotlighted on COLORS, he continues carving out a borderless sonic identity with global reach.",UC94gIQ2gnfjsHo2sEcSrx7Q,2018-01-05T20:32:07.839446Z

JuaCaliGenge,I was born Paul Nunda on the 12th of September 1979.I started rapping when I was in Jamhuri high school but I was not that actively involved in music.After finishing school in 1998 thats when I got active into music.I hooked up with Clemo my childhood friend and started calif records in the year 2000.At first I was meant to be a producer and look for guys who would rap.We hooked up with a few guys but things did not work out coz they did not have faith in us.So with pressure from clemo and a few friends I was forced to pick up the mic myself.And in the year 2001 'JUACALI' was born.Basically the name 'JUACALI' comes from my estate. It simply means 'know California' coz so many guys dont know where calif is.I released my first song 'RUKA' a dedication to Calif the same year which to our surprise went on to top the charts,UC9RpPbjGvopVlRQsBAmepjw,2017-01-09T21:16:49Z

vicmass luodollar,"PROFILE 
Ochieng Victor Ondeye alias Vicmass Luodollar a Kenyan Afro Rap Magician  currently resides in Nairobi City. [KENYA]. He started his music lesson/how to rap when he was 5 years old.

MUSIC AS A PASSION 
I did not really choose to become a rapstar and a wellknown musician. I believe it was passed from blood to blood. My Grandpa Obiero Pindwa was poet [performer]. My mother was in choir all her school life and my father was a music publisher and executive producer,he owned music stores in Kisumu City so I combined both three heads to become a musician and a lead promoter of my music which means I proof first before I let my music to the mass. 

MUSICAL INFLUENCE 
I have always been longing to play live instruments like Nyatiti, Orutu, Marimba, trumpet and Kayamba.

taught to young people. Driven by this passion and enabled by her media experience, she started The Spread Podcast.
The Spread is a sex positive podcast that only exists because there is no comprehensive sex education in Kenya. Information about sex is rooted in the negative consequences: HIV and AIDS and unwanted pregnancies. But while these are some real consequences, there’s need to highlight all the positive things that can come out of healthy, informed and consensual sexual practices.",UCE7rcmo1m-tQlYAqdUbRHGQ,2016-05-23T15:51:00Z

Dorphanage Bloc,"Spoken word artist/poet | Songwriter | Pan-African | Humanist

Dorphan is a gifted lyrical virtuoso – a blender of verse, hip hop, theatre, music and improv in his mission to be a truth-teller, a historian of self and society. His spoken word performances travel from the anguish of the personal to the uncertainties of living in a broken world. He opens the door to vulnerability and poignancy so rare in performance spaces chasing the momentary relief of comedy and lets the tirades verbalizing the pains of dispossession flow freely – telling the stories of the forgotten, the scarred, and the disenfranchised peoples – from the juicy bustle of Meru’s Gakoromone Market to the mad flavours of Eastlands Nairobi.

THEE OFFICIAL XTATIC,"￼

Ria Edna Nyarangi is a Kenyan emcee PKA XTATIC. Hailing from the capital city of Nairobi, Xtatic began her foray into 2012 with an independently produced song, “The Prep Track”, which caught the attention of major recording label Sony/RCA. Xtatic would eventually sign a multi-album deal with Sony, making her the first artist in Kenya to sign a recording deal of that magnitude.

Xtatic has been driven by the desire to properly combine the three elements of rap. “It’s all about content, flow and delivery for me. It was when she was 17 that Xtatic began making moves into taking the words in her notebooks she’d been rehearsing privately into a more public space.

She released her three-song EP titled Tatu in the last half of 2019. This is after the Let me Xplain Mixtape released back in 2015, serving as a comeback after a two-year hiatus since she parted ways with Sony Music Africa. 

She now comes back again with yet another amazing compilation, a mixtape, soXial Xperiment.",UCFCrRye00NAgqbdktrUYxkw,2020-04-21T15:24:20.084224Z

Alaine,"Alaine Laughton (born September 21, 1978), known by her first name, is a reggae singer and songwriter.[1] She was born in New Jersey, but moved to Jamaica at the age of three.

In 1988, Alaine appeared in movie Clara's Heart alongside Whoopi Goldberg.[2] Through the late 1990s and early 2000s, Alaine lived in the United States and did songwriting and singing back up for Rocafella artists such as Cam'ron and Freeway.

She moved back to Jamaica in the summer of 2004 to focus on her own music after working as an investment banker for JPMorgan Chase. Alaine later met with Craig ""Serani"" Marsh of DASECA, and started working with him. Their immediate chemistry provided Alaine with her first song on the radio within days of her arrival back to Jamaica.

In 2005 single ""No Ordinary Love"" on Don Corleon's Seasons Riddim (Sean Paul, T.O.K.) was a breakthrough single in the reggae scene, and Alaine was quickly praised for her special talents.",UCKcDyYc8cNSOnHQoLmdKS_A,2026-01-10T16:06:04.504056Z

CinemaWins,"Because liking things is more fun than not liking things.

Sometimes the critics are wrong. Some movies, while full of plot holes, continuity errors, and bad acting have plenty of wins! Every week I’ll do a movie you love, that maybe the world hates. Did you go into a movie with your mind made up? Maybe there's more greatness in it than you thought! And some movies are just so good they deserve the winning treatment.

The internet is full of so much hate and negativity, ultimately I hope my videos will brighten your day!

I use a similar format as CinemaSins specifically to be their opposite. This is just my spin on films that I think don't get the respect they deserve or are so good they need to be celebrated. Or more often, stupid crap that made me laugh and want to watch it again.

Ferg channeled his uniqueness into success, hitting the Top Ten charts with proper studio albums Trap Lord (2013) and Always Strive and Prosper (2016), and making a decent chart showing with mixtapes like 2020's Floor Seats II.

Diaper Mentality,"In comparison to other countries, Kenya is considered a ""young"" nation. Unfortunately, some of our countrymen and women take this compliment literally, and behave like the little ones. Just like children, they do their 'business' in public which is embarrassing to them and those around them. Hence the title, 'Diaper Mentality' as diapers come in handy, and shields them from making embarrassing displays. 

Many Kenyan adults, in spite of their age, display a 'diaper mentality'. They seem unable or unwilling to take charge of their lives, or act responsibly -- be it in their personal/public affairs, or even taking up their civic responsibility -- even when the consequences of their actions are detrimental to their well-being; while it is well within their power to act differently and achieve a more positive outcome. The most common being accepting a bribe for a vote, then spend five years complaining about the ineptitude of the leaders put in place.",UCV5om8NiKG4Iy2y-UqiJ4cQ,2016-01-23T13:17:30Z
