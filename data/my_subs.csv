Tipped by Billboard Magazine as the ‘the next EDM superstar’, Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll, a.k.a KYGO, has gone from bedroom producer to one of the most hyped electronic artists on the planet in unprecedented time. 

Having established himself as a household name thanks to his widely popular remixes, sell out shows in North America and Europe as well as headline performances at festivals including TomorrowWorld and Findings, KYGO signed a worldwide recording deal with Sony Music Entertainment in September. His first original track ‘Firestone’, released at the end of 2014, has now amassed over 7 million plays across SoundCloud and YouTube and over 65 million plays on Spotify, peaking at #4 in the worldwide Spotify chart. With a hotly anticipated album scheduled for 2015, plus a new live show experienced due to be unveiled at Ultra Music Festival, this is only the beginning for this 24 year old Norwegian prodigy.",UCCFJeI-2sT_cWgz-QJRgbCw,2018-04-11T22:58:21.635000Z

Thanks for stopping by!
My name is Kylie and I run this channel.

I am passionate about fashion, arbitration, scholarships and beauty.

Did I mention I am a lawyer? I strongly believe that a woman doesn’t have to choose between being brainy and beautiful! She could be both!

I’m here to break the stereotype on what a smart woman should look like! 

I aim to post a video weekly! Either a vlog or sit down video!

I seek to promote self-love, appreciation and actualization. Occasionally, I feature other creatives and professionals too.

Ultimately I hope to help you find the sunshine from within!

I am currently based in Nairobi, Kenya. I am always down to chat or connect

For 2014, that moment came at the heart of the summer season courtesy of a once unknown 20-year-old Brooklyn rapper named Bobby Shmurda and his instantaneous hit record “Hot Nigga.” Thanks to a track as menacing as it is motivational (courtesy of producer Jahlil Beats––Lil Wayne, Chris Brown) and the global introduction of Bobby’s signature boogie (“The Shmurda Dance” or “Shmoney Dance” to some), the anthem has stretched from NYC block parties to Canadian music fests to African nightclubs with its video soaring to five million YouTube views in a single month. Beyonce was seen doing Bobby’s dance; Maybach Music Group’s Meek Mill cosigned the young MC; “Shmoney Dance” could not stay out of social media feeds; a bidding war between all major labels ensued.",UClSTuQObWlw56blWZiW-wcw,2018-04-24T23:53:35.536000Z

Doja Cat,"Born and raised in L.A.,  Doja Cat made her first upload to Soundcloud in 2013 at just 16-years-old. She developed a knack for music by studying piano and dance as a kid and listening to the likes of Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and more. Soon, she went from obsessing over Catwoman to “crate digging” on YouTube and learning Logic and composition on a midi controller. Cooking up vibrantly, candy-coated beats, dropping bars doubled-up on double entendre, and singing with claws out, Amala unlocks a sweetly sexy world soundtracked by wild hip-hop, twisted pop, and smoked-out R&B. Asserting a feline-esque dominance and a style that can only be described as every color in a box of crayons, Doja Cat’s unapologetic charisma, charm, and confidence immediately take center stage. With co-signs from Chance The Rapper, Katy Perry, Chris Brown and J.Cole among others, 2018's hit “Mooo!” propelled Doja Cat forward and added many fans to her already feverishly loyal fan base.",UCzpl23pGTHVYqvKsgY0A-_w,2020-02-06T15:44:26.395000Z

Soulja Boy,"DeAndre Cortez Way (born July 28, 1990), known professionally as Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, or simply Soulja Boy, is an American rapper, record producer, actor and entrepreneur. In September 2007, his debut single ""Crank That (Soulja Boy)"" peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The single was initially self-published to the internet, and later became a number-one hit in the United States for seven non-consecutive weeks starting in September 2007.[6] On August 17, Way was listed at number 18 on the Forbes list of Hip-Hop Cash Kings of 2010 for earning $7 million for that year.[7]

His second studio album Souljaboytellem.com (2007) was his most successful album to date. His next two albums, iSouljaBoyTellem (2008) and The DeAndre Way (2010) did not match the commercial success of his debut, despite the success of several singles across both albums, such as ""Kiss Me Thru the Phone"", ""Turn My Swag On"" and ""Pretty Boy Swag"".",UCbpqhOEGlI-1lS4GfAeV2vA,2018-04-27T00:00:42.940000Z

Joey B,"Darryl Paa Kwesi Bannerman-Martin popularly known as Joey B musical influences include Wanlov, M3nsa, Drake, Kanye West and Kid Cudi.

Joey B is set to release his first album with the title ’89’ in the summer of 2017.

Having toured Ghana, Europe, the U.K. and China recently, he is fast spreading his music and widening his fan base and it’s to no surprise that this trendsetter’s fashion sense has also influenced the youth.

In May 2015, Joey B signed as the first African artiste Adidas brand ambassador.

He quite recently released the first single “U x Me” off the upcoming debut album ’89’ which has topped music charts all over Ghana.

Apocalyptica,"Hey! 

We're a rock band from Finland...our concept is kinda different as we perform mainly instrumental music with Cellos…but it's loads of fun! 

You may remember that we were playing Metallica covers using these lovely creepy-sounding cellos. You may have also heard some of our many collaborations like Corey Taylor, Adam Gontier, Till Lindemann, Nina Hagen, Max Cavalera etc.

Nowadays we like to spread our music even further where we're currently working on our 8th studio album, ""project8"" which will be released early -15. Our previous record the dance/rock-spectacle Wagner Reloaded was released in November 2013 and gave us the chance to perform with a symphony orchestra, choir and 150 dancers...it was a blast.

Now we tour all around the world we are able to play with great orchestras at cool rock clubs and festivals in amazing countries meeting lovely audiences, shooting beautiful videos and working with inspiring dudes and dudesses... I love my job.

Sheer, boundless passion for automobiles is what led to the start of Daimlar Motorsports Kenya, which in turn has grown to being a car enthusiast community – it's a passion that only true petrol heads can understand",UC4cbuKqfLUTmbo-4yNOK__Q,2018-01-13T15:31:31.998000Z

Information about sex is rooted in the negative consequences: HIV and AIDS and unwanted pregnancies. But while these are some real consequences, there’s need to highlight all the positive things that can come out of healthy, informed and consensual sexual practices.",UCE7rcmo1m-tQlYAqdUbRHGQ,2016-05-23T15:51:00Z

We are researching, collating and disseminating history and cultural heritage while linking it to present-day practice. We aim to decolonise, digitise and safeguard cultural heritage and history and provide a safe space to challenge the stories of today that have been shaped by a distorted view from the past.

The name Hiistoriya has a dual meaning, in classic Swahili it means history, while in contemporary Swahili, “hii stori ya” is slang for “the story of…”. The platform is a bridge between the past, present and the future.

Wu-Tang Clan,"Emerging in 1993, when Dr. Dre's G-funk had overtaken the hip-hop world, the Staten Island, NY-based Wu-Tang Clan proved to be the most revolutionary rap group of the mid-'90s -- and only partially because of their music. Turning the standard concept of a hip-hop crew inside out, the Wu-Tang Clan were assembled as a loose congregation of nine MCs, almost as a support group. Instead of releasing one album after another, the Clan were designed to overtake the record industry in as profitable a fashion as possible -- the idea was to establish the Wu-Tang as a force with their debut album and then spin off into as many side projects as possible. In the process, the members would all become individual stars as well as receive individual royalty checks.",UCl0q_XqiWDMA-Q9SzUO3y-Q,2018-10-17T22:54:37.219000Z

THEE OFFICIAL XTATIC,"￼

Ria Edna Nyarangi is a Kenyan emcee PKA XTATIC. Hailing from the capital city of Nairobi, Xtatic began her foray into 2012 with an independently produced song, “The Prep Track”, which caught the attention of major recording label Sony/RCA. Xtatic would eventually sign a multi-album deal with Sony, making her the first artist in Kenya to sign a recording deal of that magnitude.

Xtatic has been driven by the desire to properly combine the three elements of rap. “It’s all about content, flow and delivery for me. It was when she was 17 that Xtatic began making moves into taking the words in her notebooks she’d been rehearsing privately into a more public space.

She released her three-song EP titled Tatu in the last half of 2019. This is after the Let me Xplain Mixtape released back in 2015, serving as a comeback after a two-year hiatus since she parted ways with Sony Music Africa. 

She now comes back again with yet another amazing compilation, a mixtape, soXial Xperiment.",UCFCrRye00NAgqbdktrUYxkw,2020-04-21T15:24:20.084000Z

Vocals: SIMONE SIMONS
Vocals + Guitar: MARK JANSEN 
Synth + Piano: COEN JANSSEN
Drums + Voice: ARIËN VAN WEESENBEEK
Guitar: ISAAC DELAHAYE
Bass: ROB VAN DER LOO

Excellence. Power. Intelligence. Creativity. Ambition.

The world of symphonic metal is all about big ideas and high standards, but few bands have taken this most bombastic of genres to such momentous creative heights as EPICA. With a fresh and vital sound that struck a sublime balance between orchestral grandeur and pure heavy metal grit, EPICA’s music showcased the compelling contrast between singer Simone Simons’ soaring vocals and guitarist Mark Jansen’s guttural growls; between Isaac Delahaye’s unstoppable core of scything riffs and keyboard maestro Coen Janssen’s intricate, hugely cinematic arrangements and embellishments. All of this backed by a powerful tandem: Ariën van Weesenbeek blasting his drums and Rob van der Loo providing tasteful low end.",UC82lIgiaLTBkzhEebHWoazA,2017-11-25T20:24:15Z

SERRO KE,"Kenyan Afro-fusion singer and songwriter Serro is continuously building a name for herself as one of Kenya’s top live performers. Out to tell the African story, Serro fuses Benga with a Jazzy Afro-Pop sound laced with traditional Kenyan folk elements. Her brand is characterized by bold African facets inscribed in her lyrics, melodies, wear, and vocal delivery. A multi-instrumentalist (Guitar, Drums, and Percussion), Serro’s goal is to be “the go-to name when one thinks of live music in Africa.”

Serro's debut single ""Rongai"" produced by Sauti Sol's Polycarp ‘Fancy Fingers’ Otieno and directed by VjOne was released in 2016. After a brief hiatus to complete her music degree, Serro returned to the scene in 2019 with “Okello”, ""Ya Dunia"" ""Aheri"" and the runaway hit ""Kasyoki Wa Mitumba."" In 2020 Serro hit a career milestone by releasing her 14-track debut album - KUWE. Written and sung in five African languages, the album encompasses the different spectrums of human emotions.",UC3jh2iRv1htIn6gTwVp9-Hw,2016-10-27T16:37:32Z

Throughout the whole period, we got to learn and experience music, and especially Kenyan Music, in a different and unique light. While still actively pursuing our solo careers in the Kenyan music industry, our experiences as background vocalists prompted us to get together as Wanavokali; Solo, Backing Vocals and Harmonies for Artists, Producers, and Composers for Studio Recording Sessions and Live Performances.

lettheragebegin,"IN OATH began in early 2009 influenced highly by the metal genre; Metalcore but with time, playing shows, gaining subsequent popularity and sampling other types of music, the band decided to improve both in skill,sound and delivery. This gave birth to their First titled E.P 'Eulogy' which was offered as a free digital album download on various social music sites on April 27th 2012. A remastered version was later released via bandcamp http://inoathmetal.bandcamp.com/
Now IN OATH are currently working on an undated Album that dwells along the lines of Death Metal. A step they say which has more openings for maturity into their music.

We are a 4 piece Death metal band from Nairobi,Kenya. We base our music on life experiences and religious themes. Members of the band are: 
Douglas Kihoro - Vocals/Bass 
Larry Kim - Drums
Christopher Lilako 'Yagami' - Guitar

The Pretty Reckless,"New album 'Death By Rock And Roll' is available February 12, 2021: deathbyrockandroll.com

Formed in New York City during 2008, The Pretty Reckless and late producer Kato Khandwala initially made waves with their 2010 debut, Light Me Up. After countless gigs, the band returned with Going To Hell in 2014. Not only did the record crash the Top 5 of the Billboard Top 200, but it also ignited three #1 hits—the gold-certified “Heaven Knows” (the biggest rock song of 2014), “Fucked Up World,” and “Follow Me Down”—a feat that had not been accomplished by a female-fronted group since The Pretenders in 1984. Meanwhile, their third offering, Who You Selling For, saw them return to #1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs Chart with “Take Me Down,” which cemented them as “the first band to send its first four singles to #1 on the chart,” according to Billboard. Praise followed from Vogue, Nylon, and more as the quartet lit up television shows such as Letterman and Conan.",UCrrhJmM3H7eyxrevc4lpRIw,2018-04-18T23:45:27.102000Z

La Guardia Cross,"My name's La Guardia Cross. I make music, art, film, and I co-created 2 baby girls with my wife, Leah.

New Father Chronicles began in November of 2014 when my daughter Amalah was 1-week-old. I had no idea what I was doing, so I decided to chronicle my journey on YouTube and make fun of myself along the way. Our 2nd daughter, Nayely, was born in April of 2017.

My channel is filled with the silly adventures I have with my girls, infant and toddler interviews, my interpretations of their babble, silly skits, and the things I've learned or unlearned as a parent. Sometimes Leah and I mix it up a bit and share some pretty personal moments as well. Why? Well, we're far from perfect and we've learned a lot from our mistakes.",UCZoaoWgTo61BNTquePdHGuQ,2017-10-27T05:32:55Z

CinemaWins,"Because liking things is more fun than not liking things.

Sometimes the critics are wrong. Some movies, while full of plot holes, continuity errors, and bad acting have plenty of wins! Every week I’ll do a movie you love, that maybe the world hates. Did you go into a movie with your mind made up? Maybe there's more greatness in it than you thought! And some movies are just so good they deserve the winning treatment.

The internet is full of so much hate and negativity, ultimately I hope my videos will brighten your day!

I use a similar format as CinemaSins specifically to be their opposite. This is just my spin on films that I think don't get the respect they deserve or are so good they need to be celebrated. Or more often, stupid crap that made me laugh and want to watch it again.

OutKast's blend of gritty Southern soul, fluid raps, and the low-slung funk of their  production crew epitomized the Atlanta wing of hip-hop's rising force, the Dirty South, during the mid to late '90s. OutKast took Southern hip-hop in bold and innovative directions: less reliance on aggression, more positivity and melody, thicker arrangements, and intricate lyrics. After Andre 3000 and Big Boi hit number one on the rap charts with their first single, ""Player's Ball,"" the duo embarked on a run of platinum albums spiked with several hit singles, enjoying numerous critical accolades in addition to their commercial success.",UCaziuyHLR37c2jBkHrYSQMA,2018-04-27T23:34:58.006000Z
Skrillex,"In a cluttered home studio in downtown Los Angeles’ Arts District, mere blocks from where he wrote “Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites”, the song that sold millions of copies and helped instigate one of the largest shifts in modern American music in recent memory, the galvanizing totem of a youth movement daps at a midi controller, ceaselessly cuing the same snare sound over and over for literally hours. 

Despite being one of the biggest names in music, Skrillex hasn’t walked away from the ‘do-it-ourselves’ attitude he’s had since his start. ""It's all about making true partnerships. I think the less you can take out of something and the more you can do yourself, it's more equal-interest. So you're not taking out big bank loans, you're betting on yourself and you can sustain everything. Maybe it takes a little longer — it's been since 2004 to get to where I am now, with the same team, the same manager. hat's how we did it. There was no rush ever to get giant checks.”",UC_TVqp_SyG6j5hG-xVRy95A,2014-11-06T11:59:04Z

seankingston,"Dedicating nearly his entire life to music and achieving superstardom when he was just 17, Sean Kingston has amassed an untold amount of experience as a singer/songwriter over the years. On his third-full length album Back 2 Life, the 23-year-old builds on that experience by greatly expanding his songwriting role, nixing the multi-producer approach of his last release, and pushing for a fresh new sound. Like his 2007 self-titled debut (featuring the double-platinum breakout hit ""Beautiful Girls"") and sophomore album Tomorrow (featuring the smash singles ""Fire Burning"" and ""Face Drop""), Back 2 Life fuses reggae, hip-hop, R&B, and electro to create melody-soaked pop. But on Back 2 Life, the singer/songwriter blends his newly strengthened vocals with fiercely inventive effects and hard-hitting live instrumentation—a formula that's yielded his most passionately inspired work to date.",UCiAej2SO1sEdjj5S2RnbIhg,2018-04-27T23:34:57.851000Z
