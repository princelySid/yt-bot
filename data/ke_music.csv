JuaCaliGenge,UC9RpPbjGvopVlRQsBAmepjw,I was born Paul Nunda on the 12th of September 1979.I started rapping when I was in Jamhuri high school but I was not that actively involved in music.After finishing school in 1998 thats when I got active into music.I hooked up with Clemo my childhood friend and started calif records in the year 2000.At first I was meant to be a producer and look for guys who would rap.We hooked up with a few guys but things did not work out coz they did not have faith in us.So with pressure from clemo and a few friends I was forced to pick up the mic myself.And in the year 2001 'JUACALI' was born.Basically the name 'JUACALI' comes from my estate. It simply means 'know California' coz so many guys dont know where calif is.I released my first song 'RUKA' a dedication to Calif the same year which to our surprise went on to top the charts

THEE OFFICIAL XTATIC,UCFCrRye00NAgqbdktrUYxkw,"￼

Ria Edna Nyarangi is a Kenyan emcee PKA XTATIC. Hailing from the capital city of Nairobi, Xtatic began her foray into 2012 with an independently produced song, “The Prep Track”, which caught the attention of major recording label Sony/RCA. Xtatic would eventually sign a multi-album deal with Sony, making her the first artist in Kenya to sign a recording deal of that magnitude.

Xtatic has been driven by the desire to properly combine the three elements of rap. “It’s all about content, flow and delivery for me. It was when she was 17 that Xtatic began making moves into taking the words in her notebooks she’d been rehearsing privately into a more public space.

She released her three-song EP titled Tatu in the last half of 2019. This is after the Let me Xplain Mixtape released back in 2015, serving as a comeback after a two-year hiatus since she parted ways with Sony Music Africa. 

She now comes back again with yet another amazing compilation, a mixtape, soXial Xperiment."
